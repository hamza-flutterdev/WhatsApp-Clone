# WhatsApp-Clone 💬  
*A Flutter Portfolio Project*

WhatsApp-Clone is a Flutter-based mobile application that replicates the user interface and core navigation structure of the popular messaging app, WhatsApp. Designed as a portfolio project, it showcases my ability to build complex, multi-screen applications with an emphasis on clean UI, state management, and seamless navigation.

## 👨‍💻 About the Project

This clone focuses on the **visual and navigational fidelity** of WhatsApp, featuring:

- 📱 **Home Screen** with tab-based navigation (Chats, Status, Calls)  
- 💬 **Chat Screen** for 1-on-1 messaging interface  
- 🧾 **Status View** for browsing recent updates  
- 📞 **Call Log** for voice/video call history  
- 📷 **Camera Interface** (UI only)  
- ⚙️ **Settings Menu** for user profile and options  
- 🌗 **Light & Dark Mode** support with theme persistence

The primary objective is to **mirror WhatsApp's layout and behaviour**, offering a hands-on demonstration of UI-building capabilities using Flutter.
